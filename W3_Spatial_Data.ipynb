By the end of the year, 9,917 fires had burned more than 4% of the state's area, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history. California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\", burning over 1 million acres across seven counties, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. The fires destroyed over 10,000 structures and cost over \\$12.079 billion (2020 USD) in damages, including over \\$10 billion in property damage and \\$2.079 billion in fire suppression costs. The intensity of the fire season has been attributed to a combination of more than a century of poor forest management and higher temperatures resulting from climate change.\n",

When we think of wildfires, we think of short-term events — and hopefully they are — but they can have long-term consequences considering your overall air pollution exposure.”\n",
